        * faecher.py: faecher renamed to infFaecher. etechFaecher: new.
         faecher now is a merge of both. Due to clashes in the abbreviations
         for courses in etech there is more work to do...

        Several changes made to group by semestergroups enclosed in the entry
        itself instead to group by the semestergroup from the header.
        Goal: get on with the Sem_EuI.txt calendar-text file.

        * hawParser.py(declaration): token 'fach' widened with (sub) token
         'gruppe' 
        * hawParserTest.py(testDeclaration): new test-case for token 'fach'
         and 'gruppe'

        * hawParserDispatchProcessor(gruppe): new
        * hawParserDispatchProcessor(fach): returns now 'fach' and 'gruppe'

        * hawCalendar.py(__init__): changed type of param
         eventTupelLists to account for the changes in the result-format
         from the HawDispatchProcessor
